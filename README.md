# An-Alternative-History

This is a project I've been wanting to work on for quite a while. The idea is to create a web application that presents little known pieces of history. History was always one of my favourite subjects at school and is something I take a big interest in.

This project is on the back-burner at the moment whilst I work on other more pressing projects.

The aim is to complete this whilst working on a 100 days of code.
